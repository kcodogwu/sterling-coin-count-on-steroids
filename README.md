# Sterling Coin Count on Steroids

Sterling Coin Count on Steroids is the crazy cousin to [Sterling Coin Count](https://github.com/kcodogwu/sterling-coin-count). Just like his cousin, when given a number of pennies will calculate the minimum number of pound sterling coins needed to make that amount.

The app accounts for only the common £2, £1, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p and 1p coins.

## Illustration
Below are sample inputs and an idea of what the output should be:
* 123p = 1 x £1, 1 x 20p, 1 x 2p, 1 x 1p.
* £12.34 = 6 x £2, 1 x 20p, 1 x 10p, 2 x 2p.

> ## NB
> This was done on the Windows operating system. If you plan to make use of this with [Bash unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29),
> in `package.json` file, in the `scripts` section, you would want to change the `clean` script to something like this:
> ```
> "clean": "rm -rf dist && mkdir dist/public/js",
> ```
